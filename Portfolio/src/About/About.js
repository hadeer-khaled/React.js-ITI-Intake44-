          Currently, I am an open-source applications developer at Information
          Technology Institute, where I am acquiring valuable technical and soft
          skills. I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering at Cairo
          University in 2023 with a very good overall grade, and an A+ for my
          graduation project. During my time at university, I participated with
          my team in the NLP Competition at Nile University AI Hackathon to
          solve a Named Entity Recognition problem, and we achieved fourth place
          out of ten teams. Moreover, I participated in the _VOIS Vantage 2022
          Competition - Egypt Track with two of my friends to solve real-life
          strategy case studies and achieved first place ðŸ¥‡.
